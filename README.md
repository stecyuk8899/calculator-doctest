# Functions to Perform Arithmetic Calculations

The `calculations.py` Python module provides basic arithmetic
operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Here are a few examples of how to use the functions in `calculations.py`:

```python
>>> import calculations

>>> calculations.add(2, 2)
4.0

>>> calculations.subtract(2, 2)
0.0

>>> calculations.multiply(2, 2)
4.0

>>> calculations.divide(2, 2)
1.0

```
